## Digital Forensics 
- investigating computers that have been compromise by an attacker

- Digital Investigation
	-  it's hard to know where to start + there is a lot of places to look
	-  solution:
		1. Break into Smaller Questions
		2. Artifact Categories
		-> the question that needs to be answered - Is it specific enough to completely answer with a single artifact category? if not -> break it down and repeat on each of those new questions

	- plus prioritization

	- 4 questions:	
		- Are there malicious hardware-related changes? (firmware, BIOS)
		- Are there malicious OS configuration changes? (services enabled, logging disabled,...)
		- Are there malicious programs? (backdoors, keystroke loggers, ...)
		- Is there malicious user activity? (account takeover, insider thread,...)

- tools -> collections/analysis
