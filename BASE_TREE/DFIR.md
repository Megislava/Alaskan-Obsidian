## Digital Forensics 
- investigating computers that have been compromise by an attacker

### Digital Investigation/Forensics
-  it's hard to know where to start + there is a lot of places to look
-  solution:
	1. Break into Smaller Questions
	2. Artifact Categories
	-> the question that needs to be answered - Is it specific enough to completely answer with a single artifact category? if not -> break it down and repeat on each of those new questions

- plus prioritization

- 4 questions:	
	- Are there malicious hardware-related changes? (firmware, BIOS)
	- Are there malicious OS configuration changes? (services enabled, logging disabled,...)
	- Are there malicious programs? (backdoors, keystroke loggers, ...)
	- Is there malicious user activity? (account takeover, insider thread,...)

- tools -> collections/analysis
