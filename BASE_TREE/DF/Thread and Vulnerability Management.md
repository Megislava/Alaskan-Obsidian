## Vulnerability Management

- vulnerability
	- = weakness that (individually or in conjuction with others) could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on a systenm or network
 
##### DARC:
1. Detect 
	- vulnerability scanning
	- detecting configuration issues -> [[Lynis]]
2. Asses
	- CVSS - common vulnerability scoring system
		- 0.1 - 3.9 ~ Low; 4.0 - 6.9 ~ Medium; 7.0 - 8.9 ~ High; 9.0 - 10.0 ~ Critical
		- metrics: 
			- base = characteristics of a vulnerability that never change; 8 vectors
				- Attack - AV (access vector), AC (attack complexity)
				- Access - PR (privileges required), UI (user interaction)
				- Impact - S (scope), C;I;A (impact on confidentiality;integrity;availability)
			- temporal = characteristics of a vulnerability that may change
				- exploit maturity code (E)
				- remediation level (RL)
				- report confidence (RC)
			- environmental = customizing to specific asset
				- C;I;A requirement (CR;IR;AR)
3. Remediate/Resolve
	- patching and config manager platforms
		- Microsoft SCCP
		- Red Had Satellite
		- IBM BigFix
		- Symantec Altiris
		- Tanium
		- 1E Tachyon
4. Confirm

##### Security Assesment
- Risk Assesment
	- determine where the organization imay be exposed to a risk
	- threads and vulnerabilties -> NIST
		- thread - circumstance/event that could damage the C/I/A of information or information systems
		- vulnerability - a weakness that enables the thread to be successful
	- identify and score
- Security Control Assesment
	- determine whether or not your security program meets the specific requirements outlined by some external authority
	- security control frameworks - defined set of controls designed to minimize risks to CIA of systems, applications and data
		- eg. ISO 27000 Family (27001/27002), NIST (SP 800 - computer security, SP 1800 - cybersecurity practice guides, SP 500 - information technology)
	- -> report - prioritized list of control gaps
- Compliance Assesment
	- determine whether or not your security program meets the specific requirements outlined by some external authority
	- PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA,...
- Vulnerability Assesment
	- validate that technical vulnerabilities are being identified and remediated on a regular basis
	- servers, endpoints, networks, applications, databases,...
	- often using automated tools - [[Nessus]], [[OWASP Zap]], [[Scuba]]
	- output: prioritized vulnerabilities, information regarding potential exploits, remediation recomendations
- Penetration Test
	- attempt to exploit weakness an attacker might take advantage of to damage the organization
	- takes input from the other assesments
	- white box, grey box, black box
