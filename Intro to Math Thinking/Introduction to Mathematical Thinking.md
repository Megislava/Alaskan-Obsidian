		1. If x then y
		2. x is sufficient for y
		3. x only if y
		4. y if x
		5. y whenever x
		6. y is necessary for x
	
phi | psi | phi => psi
--- | --- | -----
1 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
0 | 0 | 1

- equivalence
	- symbol is <=>
	- following all means "x is equivalent to y":
		1. x is necessary and sufficient for y
		2. x if and only if y ("if and only if" ~ "iff")
