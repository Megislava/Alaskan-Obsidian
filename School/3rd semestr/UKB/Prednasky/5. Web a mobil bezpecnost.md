- websites
	- frontend
		- code running in browser on client side
		- user can see source code
		- commonly: HTML, CSS, JS,...
		- vulnerabilities: XSS,...
	- backend
		- code running on server -> user cannot see source code
		- common programming languages: PHP, Java, Node,...
		- often connected to DB
		- HTTP 1 stateless -> statefull with cookie and session variables 
		- vulnerabilities: session hijacking,...
- SSI = Server Side Includes
	- enables input of another code into static HTML while loading
	- making static sides partly dynamic

- user input
	- should be considered malicious by default -> security by design
	- any form can be misused (search, login, comment, adding into shopping cart,..)
	- important to check HTTP POST and to pay attention to hidden content in forms
	- validate on frontend and backend
	- directory traversal - changing URL to get to different (previously not accessible) place

- HTTP headers
	- request + response
	- referrer-policy, cache-control, X-XSS-protection, X-Frame-options, content-security-policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security Header (HSTS), HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP), ...
		- CSP - now v3, when used a policy is defined where external sources can be uploaded from, protection against XSS and data injections
		- HTST - HTTPs is forced, protection against Man in the Middle, header is applied to ALL ports so webapp should have valid certs and HTTPs connection
		- HPKP - similar to HTST, guarantees accepting server response only when it has valid cert, prevents creating false certs for a domain
		- X-Frame-Options - prevents webapp from being embedded in iframe, protects against clickjacking
		- Referrer-Policy - how much information should be included in Referer header (indicates previous web page)
		- Set-Cookie - with Secure (cookies set with HTTPs only) and HttpOnly (cookies cannot be accessed via JS, some protection against XSS) flags

- connection encryption
	- SSL, TLS
	- ways to attack:
		- redirecting from HTTPs to HTTP - HSTS is preventing
		- changing communication to weaker encryption
		- redirecting communication through own domain - URL squatting

- OWASP top 10
	- Broken Access Control
	- Cryptographic Failures
		- data transmitted in clear text, weak keys, reused keys, ...
	- Injections
	- Insecure Design
	- Security Misconfiguration
		- bad config of web environment,...
		- defense: hardening (web server, application server, webapp), update libraries and frameworks, uninstall unused components, frameworks, services and ports, change default directories, correct setting of user authorization, change default users and password
		- security though obscurity
	- Vulnerable and outdated components
		- defense: update :D, vuln scans, monitor new CVE,...
	- Identification and Authentication failures
	- Software and Data integrity failures
	- Security logging and monitoring failures
		- vuln: not logged unsuccessful logins, login logged only locally, bad wording of errors/warnings
		- defense: good login messages, log all logins, check for integrity of audit records
	- Server-Side Request Forgery

- web application testing
	- SAST = Static Application Security Testing
		- source code application testing, "inside-out" testing
		- positives: does not require running system, quick
		- negatives: high rate of false-positives, not possible to find vulns in third party services
	- DAST = Dynamic Application Security Testing
		- tests application via frontend, "outside-in" testing
		- positives: does not require access to source code, low rate of false positives, can be performed as black box
		- negatives: does not identify which part of software is the problematic, can cause incident if done in prod, time intensive
	- IAST = Interactive Application Security Testing
		- combines SAST and DAST
		- works over running application, does not need access to source code
	- RAST = Run-time Application Security Testing

- mobile security
	- keep it up to date
	- use antivirus
	- periodically backup of sensitive data
	- use security platforms in case of device theft (device can be locked remotely,...)
	- avoid connecting to unsecured/untrusted wifi, use VPN
	- use lock screen, turn off notifications preview on lock screen
	- SIM card pin protection
	- use 2FA
	- encrypt memory card and internal storage
	- download apps from reputable sources
		- and check for weird permissions
- MDM = Mobile Device Management
	- arranging control over mobile devices with various OS in company environment
	- enforcing rules, runs scans, locks device, starts a siren, keeps devices updated, deletes data from devices, web filtering, turn off camera/NFC/GPS/USB connections,...
