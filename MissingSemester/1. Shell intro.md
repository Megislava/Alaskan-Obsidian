- `date` - prints date
- `echo hello` - prints hello
- `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`
- `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`
- `>`, `>>`, `|`
- `<` - rewiring output like with `>` but the other way round
	- ```
	missing:~$ echo hello > hello.txt
	missing:~$ cat hello.txt
	hello
	missing:~$ cat < hello.txt
	hello
	missing:~$ cat < hello.txt > hello2.txt
	missing:~$ cat hello2.txt
	hello```
- finding stuff
	1. files
	- `find`
	- ```	
		# Find all directories named src
		find . -name src -type d
		# Find all python files that have a folder named test in their path
		find . -path '*/test/*.py' -type f
		# Find all files modified in the last day
		find . -mtime -1
		# Find all zip files with size in range 500k to 10M
		find . -size +500k -size -10M -name '*.tar.gz'
		# Delete all files with .tmp extension
		find . -name '*.tmp' -exec rm {} \;
		# Find all PNG files and convert them to JPG
		find . -name '*.png' -exec convert {} {}.jpg \;
	- alternative to `find`: [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
	- find and fd are not indexed searched
	- `locate` is indexed search
		- indexed by daily cron job
		- but uses/searched by name only
	2. Code
		- `grep`
		- alternatives: `ack`, `ag`, `rg`
		- `rp` - ripgrep
			- ```
				# Find all python files where I used the requests library
				rg -t py 'import requests'
				# Find all files (including hidden files) without a shebang line
				rg -u --files-without-match "^#!"
				# Find all matches of foo and print the following 5 lines
				rg foo -A 5
				# Print statistics of matches (# of matched lines and files )
				rg --stats PATTERN
- `sudo`

		- `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace`
- directory navigation
	- symlinks `ln -s`
