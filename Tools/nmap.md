- host discovery, scanning and enumerating services - ports that are open and what is running on them
- `-sS`: SYN scan - sends SYN packets to port and sees how they responds (if it responds with SYN/ACK the port is open), default scan, stealthy
- `-sT`: TCP scan - to make sure that you don't have any false positives
- `-sU`: scan UDP
- `--send-ip`: when running locally and checking in wireshark (wireshark would not show the correct IP if this is off)
- `-sV`: what version of software is running on the port
- `-sA`: ACK scan - whether the port is filtered - if port is not expecting ACK it will respond with RST
- `-sX`, `-sN`, `-sF` (Xmas, Null, FIN scan) - exploit a loophole in the TCP RFC to differentiate between open and closed ports, often used as a firewall evadion
	- Xmas scan: sends FIN, PSH and IRC flags (lightning the packets like Christmas tree)
	- Null scan: doesn't send any bits (TCP flag head is 0)
	- FIN scan: sends just TCP FIN bit, good for slipping through non-stable firewalls
- `-sn`: ping sweep - use in conjustion with IP address range, eg: `nmap -sn 192.168.0.1.-254`
- `-f`: fragmentation
	- firewall or IDS evasion tactic
- `--mtu <number>`: control the size of the packets
- `--scan-delay <number>`: used to add a delay betwen packets sent, evasion of firewall/IDS
- `--badsum`: used to generate invalid checksums for packets, can be use to determine the presence of firewall/IDS
- `-D`: decoy - adds source of the traffic (but in logs of target it shows both - ours and the decoy)
- `-e`: what adapter do you want to use
- `-S`: spoofed IP of source (in target's logs it shows only the spoofed one)
- `T0-5`: paranoid | sneaky | polite | normal | aggressive | insane
- `-A`: aggressive scan
- `-p`: looks for specific ports
	- `-` : all ports (0-65535?)
	- `3, 42, 211`: these ports
	- `233-532`: there ports - range
- `--open`: returns only opens ports
- `-O`: guesses operating system
- `-v`: verbose
- `--script=<script_name>`: goes and runs the script/script folder against target
	- auth: attempt to bypass authentication for running services
	- broadcast, default, dos, external, fuzzer, malvare, version
	- brute (force): attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
	- discovery: attempt to query running services for futher information about the network (e query and SNMP server)
	- exploit: attempt to exploit a vulnerability
	- intrusive: not safe: likely to affent the target
	- safe: won't affect the target
	- vuln (vulnerable): scan for vulnerabilites
	- Nmap Scripting Enginge (NSE) - powerful addition to Nmap
	- searching for script: `grep "ftp" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`
- `-o`: output params:
	- `-oN`: normal; `-oX`: XML; `-oG`: grappable
	- `-oA`: all
- `-Pn`: disables ping (some targets can have forbidden ping/icmp)
- `-n`: turn off name resolution (increase in speed)
- `-iL <path>`: input files/tooks IP addresses and runs them as target
